            <article id="dev"><p>In order to begin writing programs in Java on your computer, there are a couple steps you need to take.</p>
                <h2>Download Java</h2><p>
                First you need to actually download Java. Without Java and it’s Virtual Machine or JDK, you cannot write any programs in Java because your computer won’t have the technologies needed to understand your programs. To install Java, <a href='https://www.java.com/en/download/help/download_options.xml' target="_blank">click here.</a></p>
                <h2>Choose an IDE</h2><p>
                Next, you need to choose what IDE to develop your code with. An IDE is an Integrated Development Environment, which helps to make creating programs easier, and it also helps to make your code cleaner and easier to read. There are plenty of options for IDE that work well with Java. Here are two main picks.<br><br>
                <a href="http://www.jcreator.com/">Jcreator</a> - a good beginner IDE that doesn’t have much extra stuff which helps with more advanced and involved projects.<br><br>
                <a href="https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/">IntelliJ</a> - a great IDE all around which is more sophisticated and has plenty of great technologies which make creating big projects easy.</p>
                <h2>Extra Tips</h2><p>
                After the first two steps, you begin writing and compiling code, but you’re not done yet. Some additional resources that will help bring your skills to the top are <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a>. <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/">Stack Overflow</a> is a website which connects a huge community of developers and allows for people to get help when they are stumped by a problem with their code. General questions about programming may also be asked. More often than not, any questions you have are already asked and answered by other people, so you don’t need to wait for help. Alongside this, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a great tool for if you like to have a repository for your projects, or if you are developing projects using multiple devices, or with help from multiple people. Essentially, <a href="https://github.com/">GitHub</a> is a website that can connect to your computer, and which updates itself with your code as you work and save. This makes downloading, transferring, and saving your code a breeze - no more need for a flash drive.</p>

            <article id="fix">
                <h2>Infix Notation</h2>
                <p>We write expressions in infix notation, e.g. a - b + c, where operators are used in-between operands. It is easy for us humans to read, write, and speak in infix notation but the same does not go well with computing devices. An algorithm to process infix notation could be difficult and costly in terms of time and space consumption.</p>
                <h2>Prefix Notation</h2>
                <p>In this notation, the operators are prefixed to operands, i.e. the operator is written ahead of operands. For example, +ab. This is equivalent to its infix notation a + b. Prefix notation is also known as Polish Notation.</p>
                <h2>Postfix Notation</h2>
                <p>This notation style is known as Reverse Polish Notation. In this notation style, the operator is postfixed to the operands i.e., the operator is written after the operands. For example, ab+. This is equivalent to its infix notation a + b.</p>
                <h2>Precedence</h2>
                <p>When an operand is in between two different operators, which operator will take the operand first, is decided by the precedence of an operator over others. For example − a + b * c -> a + ( b * c )</p>
                <h2>Associativity</h2>
                <p>Associativity describes the rule where operators with the same precedence appear in an expression. For example, in expression a + b − c, both + and – have the same precedence, then which part of the expression will be evaluated first, is determined by associativity of those operators. Here, both + and − are left associative, so the expression will be evaluated as (a + b) − c.<br><br>Precedence and associativity determines the order of evaluation of an expression.<br><br>PEMDAS is still used for all the above notations.</p>
                <h2>Postfix to Infix Algorithm</h2><p>Algorithm on how to evaluate postfix notation −<br>Step 1 − scan the expression from left to right <br>Step 2 − if it is an operand push it to stack <br>Step 3 − if it is an operator pull operand from stack and perform operation <br>Step 4 − store the output of step 3, back to stack <br>Step 5 − scan the expression until all operands are consumed <br>Step 6 − pop the stack and perform operation<br>Hint: Scan from the side with the numbers first</p><h2>Prefix to Infix Algorithm</h2>
                <p>Same as Postfix to Infix except you scan from right to left
                <br>Hint: Scan from the side with the numbers first</p>
                <h2>Infix to Postfix</h2>
                <p>Step 1 - Scan the Infix string from left to right.
                <br>Step 2 - If the scanned character is an operand, add it to the Postfix string.
                <br>Step 3 - If the scanned character is an operator and if the stack is empty push the character to stack.
                <br>Step 4 - If the scanned character is an Operator and the stack is not empty, compare the precedence of the character with the element on top of the stack.
                <br>Step 5 - If top Stack has higher precedence over the scanned character pop the stack else push the scanned character to stack. Repeat this step until the stack is not empty and top Stack has precedence over the character.
                <br>Step 6 - Repeat 4 and 5 steps till all the characters are scanned.
                <br>Step 7 - After all characters are scanned, we have to add any character that the stack may have to the Postfix string.
                <br>Step 8 - If stack is not empty add top Stack to Postfix string and Pop the stack.</p>
                <h2>Infix to Prefix</h2>
                <p>Same as Infix to Postfix except you scan from right to left and you must add to the front of the Output String, not the back.</p>
