            <h2>Who We Are</h2>
            <p>The Computer Science Club is a small, but dedicated group of students that want to delve into more comprehensive Computer Science topics. This knowledge is then put to use at UIL Competitions where treams of 3 have a chance to represent their school and to show off their skills.</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <h2>Meetings</h2>
            <p>Our club reserves time for meetings every Friday morning at 8:20, on B Days. Since our club sponsor is Mrs. Windell, Computer Science Club's meetings are hosted in her room - C222.</p>
            <p>The general purpose for our meetings is to practice for UIL as a group using try-fail-learn paradigm lectures in which you are given advanced problems which you are asked to solve, and then as a group we deconstruct the questions and together we come up with an answer to the questions which are then affirmed by a lesson. Besides this, meetings are fairly open and we try also to introduce other non-UIL Competitions and to talk about things and developments happening in the global Computer Science community.</p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <h2>Joining</h2>
            <p>Anyone can join. Of course it would be best if you have a background in Computer Science, but if not you can still become a member if you are generally interested - we will try our best to prepare you for UIL. Further, there is no fee for Computer Science thus far, but that may change if we ever decide to create a club t-shirt in the future.</p>
            <p>Along with joining, their are requirements to becoming an official member and staying an official member. To be an official member and to retain your status, you must come to at least 4 meetings. You must also go to at least 1 UIL event. Of course, you do not need to be hugely successful at UIL to become an official member, but it certainly helps.</p>
            <p>If you are still interested in joining, please sign up at this link: <a href="signup.html">Sign-Up.</a></p>
            <p class="break"></p>
            <h2>Future</h2>
            <p>Though our main foucs as a club right now is UIL events, not every club is about competing and being tested. Mostly, clubs are a way to bring together people of common interests and to create and discuss cool things based on that collective interest. In the future of this particular club, we would like to have more club fun, such as hosting our own hack-a-thons (school lock-ins in which we all discuss COmputer Science and program together with delicious food to accompany us.) Further, as a a club, we could create group projects for our school, or just for the heck of it (networking, database querying and displaying, medium scaled multi-player games.)</p>
