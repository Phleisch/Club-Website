            <h2>How to Practice</h2>
            <p>The UIL Computer Science Competition is a two part endeavor. First off there is a 40 question exam which you have 45 minutes to complete. To get a general idea of the topics on the test and the order which they may appear, check out this link: <a href="http://www.uiltexas.org/files/academics/UILCS-JavaTopicList1617.pdf" target="_blank">Topics.</a> When you use the material below to practice the written tests, in general gauge what you know first by taking an assessment test, and then practice what you know first, what you kinda of know second, and what you don't know last. It's better to know some topics really well on this test than it is to kinda know a bunch of things.</p>
            <p>Secondly there is the hands-on component. During this time you will be with two or less people working with one computer on a packet of 12 questions which you must solve programmatically and then send to the judge. There is two hours of total working time available for this segment. Generally, practice is much different than solving these problems as a group and at the competition, for when you practice you cannot actually submit your code to a judge, but you can judge it yourself. Also you won't have others to help you if your code is broken and buggy. Individual hands on practice is still very much recommended as your group will only be as strong as your weakest link - don't be dead weight and constantly ask your teammates to assist you with your code.</p>

            <h2>Written</h2>
            <p>As mentioned before, the test portion of UIL Computer Science involves 40 questions to be completed in 45 minutes. Furthermore, for every question you answer correctly 6 points are gained, for every question you skip nothing is gained, and for every question you answer incorrectly you lose 2 points. Therefore, answer only the questions you know, and as well make sure to time yourself when you practice in order to properly prepare for the real deal. Here is all available practice tests, answer keys, and explanations: <a href="Test%20Practice.zip">Practice Tests.</a></p>

            <h2>Hands-On</h2>
            <p>With hands on, it's good to practice with a group. But, before you get to that level, practice as many programming questions as possible by yourself without help so that you and your teammates can divide and conquer more efficiently, and only collaborate on the harder problems. If you don't have Java or an IDE on your computer, then you should get those products before downloading this material. The instructions for turning your computer into a Java developer environment is here: <a href="learn.html">Developer Steps.</a> The questions to download are here: <a href="Coding%20Practice.zip">Hands-on Practice.</a></p>
            <p>One thing to note, mixed in with UIL hands-on problems are problems from Code Quest and Code Wars, which are valued differently. With UIL hands-on, every correct problem is worth 40 points, where you lose 5 points on a problem for every incorrect submission. Though Code Wars and Code Quest problems aren't like this, they are challenging problems nonetheless and make for good practice.</p>
